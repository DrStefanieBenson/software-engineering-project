# software-engineering-project

This project uses a dataset involving car advertisements which include the number of ads for various makes and models of vehicle as well as typical car characteristics one would find in a for-sale ad.

This repository also contains the data set, the documents necessary to create a web application used to visualize the information presented, and the exploratory data analysis.

Notes to Project Reviewer
- I attempted to deploy this project to Render but got the error: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'
- I reviewed the lesson information, and I'm going to be honest, this sprint is overly challenging and I could not figure out what to do next to get this project deployed using Render.  I don't feel comfortable asking for help in discord as its hard to get anyone that is available to help in a personal way and not being in the data field to begin with, I often feel discouraged by my interactions with them.  I don't have a specific tutor to reach out to, but I have gotten excellent support from a few evaluators, so I am hoping you can provide some more targetted guidance.
