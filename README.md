# software-engineering-project

This project uses a dataset involving car advertisements which include the number of ads for various makes and models of vehicle as well as typical car characteristics one would find in a for-sale ad.

This repository also contains the data set, the documents necessary to create a web application used to visualize the information presented, and the exploratory data analysis.
