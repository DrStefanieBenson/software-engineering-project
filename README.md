# software-engineering-project

This project uses a dataset involving car advertisements which include the number of ads for various makes and models of vehicle as well as typical car characteristics one would find in a for-sale ad.

This repository also contains the data set, the documents necessary to create a web application used to visualize the information presented, and the exploratory data analysis.

<b>Notes to Project Reviewer</b>
- Link for Render: https://customer-and-manufacturer-advertisement.onrender.com
- I was able to address all feedback in the EDA and included data cleaning for all major outliers.  I also added more data visualization to some of my calculations.  Any additional notes are appreciated
- I updated the code for app.py
- I manually deployed render with the new commits.  Everything initiated, except for 1 error which I could not resolve.  Please see the image pasted below for the error message.  I have posted this to discord as well, but have not yet received feedback

- Here is what the bottom portion of the deploy code looks like.  It says "deploy successful" and then all of this pops up

- I appreciate you following up with my community manager about lack of support.  She did reach out to see if I needed help/a 1-1 session.  I replied 3 days ago and have not yet heard back, so we'll see how that goes.  Thank you for your support with this project, any direct advise would be appreciated.
